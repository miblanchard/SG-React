# React Study Guide: Connect-Four Game

### For this exercise you will be building a Connect-4 Game with React.js. 
#### The boiler-plate code for running your node server and styling the page is provided-- your job is to create the appropriate React components and component methods so the game works.

First, run `npm install` to get all of the dependancies you'll need. I wrote a build script to compile the jsx in the /client/src folder for you-- it runs automatically when you call `npm start`. Still, you might want to practice setting up a React build system-- if you want to do that, just delete the script and set your own stuff up. (Browserify and Babelify are already included. )
